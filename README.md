# EXCEL TO LETTERS

For this problem we need to know how to works the excel columns, in this case the first column is the column with the letter A, the columns goes forward until the column with the letter Z, after excel add a second letter to add new columns. Now the problem ask for the number of the column, for example the column with the letter A is the column one and the column with the letter Z is the column twenty-six, the input should be a letter combinations and the output must be the number of column that represent those letters.

**Examples**

Input

```
L
Z
```

Output

`26`

Input

```
N
26
```

Output

`Z`

For this example the program gets the letter 'L' or the letter 'N', this means that the program must convert from letters to a number in the 'L' case, or from numbers to letter in the case of 'N'.
